=head1 NAME

DNS::Oterica::Hub - the center of control for a DNS::Oterica system

=head1 VERSION

version 0.204

=head1 OVERVIEW

The hub is the central collector of DNS::Oterica data.  All new entries are
given to the hub to collect.  The hub takes care of preventing duplicates and
keeping data synchronized.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 ns_family

This is the name of the family whose hosts will be used for NS records for
hosts and in SOA lines.

=head2 hostmaster

This is the email address to be used as the contact point in SOA lines.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 domain

  my $new_domain = $hub->domain($name => \%arg);

  my $domain = $hub->domain($name);

This method will return a domain found by name, or if C<\%arg> is given, will
create a new domain.

If no domain is found and C<\%arg> is not given, an exception is raised.

If C<\%arg> is given for a domain that already exists, an exception is raised.

=head2 network

  my $net = $hub->network($name);

This method finds the named network and returns it.  If no network for the
given name is registered, an exception is raised.

=head2 networks

  my @net = $hub->networks;

=head2 add_network

  my $net = $hub->add_network(\%arg);

This registers a new network, raising an exception if one already exists for
the given name.

=head2 host

  my $host = $hub->host($domain_name, $hostname);

  my $new_host = $hub->host($domain_name, $hostname, \%arg);

This method will find or create a host, much like the C<L</domain>> method.

=head2 nodes

This method will return a list of all nodes registered with the system.

B<Warning>: at present this will return only hosts.

=head2 node_family

  my $family = $hub->node_family($family_name);

This method will return the named familiy.  If no such family exists, an
exception will be raised.

=head2 node_families

  my @families = $hub->node_families;

This method will return all node families.  (These are set up during hub
initialization.)
